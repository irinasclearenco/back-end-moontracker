For the most accurate results, wait until a few day after you miss your period before you take a pregnancy test, use your first morning pee so hCG levels are more concentrated, and follow the directions on your test carefully. If you get a negative pregnancy test but your period hasn't come, wait a few days and test again.\n" +
